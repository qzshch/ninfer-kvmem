# NInfer XGrammar source base

This implementation originates from [XGrammar](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar),
commit [`3641b5c21e70a6c5515ad9eca24fcbee21ee6ad0`](https://github.com/mlc-ai/xgrammar/commit/3641b5c21e70a6c5515ad9eca24fcbee21ee6ad0),
under the Apache License 2.0; see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

NInfer owns the CMake target and maintains its adaptations here, adopting upstream changes
selectively. Cold compilation is limited to two concurrent callers per compiler; the adapter
uses one caller thread per compile, without creating a thread pool. Python/TVM bindings, GPU kernels,
Web code, upstream tests and build machinery are excluded.

Grammar string escaping preserves embedded NUL bytes, including in compilation cache keys.

The CPU dependency closure includes Lark and all format converters referenced by the shared
factories. `cpp/testing.cc` also supplies token-formatting diagnostics used by the matcher and
compiled grammar; it is part of this library, not a test executable.

Bundled header dependencies:

- `3rdparty/picojson/picojson.h`: XGrammar's modified version, including ordered-object support;
  its license is in the header.
- `3rdparty/dlpack/include/dlpack/dlpack.h`: from the upstream submodule at
  [`bbd2f4d32427e548797929af08cfe2a9cbb3cf12`](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/commit/bbd2f4d32427e548797929af08cfe2a9cbb3cf12);
  see its [LICENSE](3rdparty/dlpack/LICENSE).

`ninfer_xgrammar` is a C++20 static library linked explicitly by consumers. It uses standard
threads and has no Python, TVM or CUDA runtime dependency. Cpptrace is disabled.
